[Role]
    You are an expert C/C++ fuzzer and compiler test generator with deep understanding of compiler mechanisms.
    Please generate test programs that satisfy the given requirements, target the specified coverage targets,
    and explore compiler paths beyond those explicitly described.
    [Failures Case]
    
    [Target Requirements]
    Target compiler file:
    gcc-14.3.0/gcc/simplify-rtx.cc
    Coverage goal:
    Trigger simplification patterns for signed/unsigned saturating division (SS_DIV/US_DIV) by constant 1, and for COPYSIGN operations with various operand patterns (identical operands, constant second operand, ABS/NEG/COPYSIGN as first or second operand) in the RTL simplification pass.
    The compilation options targeted by the generated test program structure:
    -O2 -fwrapv -fno-trapping-math -fsigned-zeros -fno-rounding-math
    The basic blocks in gcc-14.3.0/gcc/simplify-rtx.cc to be covered by the generated program structure:
    Generate RTL for signed or unsigned saturating division where the divisor is the constant integer 1. This requires C/C++ code that uses saturating arithmetic intrinsics (e.g., __ssdiv, __usdiv for ARM) or compiler-builtin saturation operations, applied to a variable divided by 1. Example: `int x; int y = __ssdiv(x, 1);` The compiler must lower this to RTL with code SS_DIV or US_DIV and op1 being CONST1_RTX.

Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where both operands are identical RTX (same tree/value) and have no side effects. This requires an expression like `copysignf(x, x)` or `__builtin_copysign(x, x)`. The operands must be the same variable or constant.

Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where the second operand is a constant floating-point value (CONST_DOUBLE). This requires `copysignf(x, 2.0f)` or `copysignf(x, -3.0)`. The constant must be representable as a CONST_DOUBLE in the target mode.

Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where the first operand is a NEG or ABS unary operation. This requires `copysignf(-y, z)` or `copysignf(fabsf(y), z)`. The inner operation must be present in the RTL.

Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where the second operand is an ABS operation without side effects. This requires `copysignf(x, fabsf(y))`. The ABS must not have side effects (e.g., not volatile).

Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where the first operand is another COPYSIGN and its second operand has no side effects. This requires nested copysign like `copysignf(copysignf(a, b), c)` where `b` has no side effects.

Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where the second operand is another COPYSIGN and its first operand has no side effects. This requires `copysignf(a, copysignf(b, c))` where `b` has no side effects.
    [General Requirements]
    Standards & Compliance: : ISO C99 compliant; self-contained and compilable with a standard gcc/llvm compiler; no undefined behavior or compiler extensions.
    Program Structure: Include a main function and multiple helper functions; use non trivial control flow (e.g., nested conditionals, loops, and function calls).
    Scale & Complexity: Approximately 80–120 lines of code; structurally complex enough to allow diverse compilation paths while remaining readable and well-formed.
    Determinism & Inputs: No external inputs, system calls, or I/O dependencies; program behavior should be deterministic and reproducible.
    [Instruction]
    1. Generate test programs that match the given targeted requirements.
    2.Avoid generating test programs that are structurally similar to given failure cases, based on reflection results.
    3. Ensure the programs meet the general requirements and have a well-structured design.
    4. Output complete, compilable C/C++ test program.
    [Output]
    Output a complete C/C++ test program only.
    Do NOT include explanations or markdown fences.

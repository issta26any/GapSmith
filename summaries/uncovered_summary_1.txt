[Coverage Goal] - Trigger simplification patterns for signed/unsigned saturating division (SS_DIV/US_DIV) by constant 1, and for COPYSIGN operations with various operand patterns (identical operands, constant second operand, ABS/NEG/COPYSIGN as first or second operand) in the RTL simplification pass.
[Compile Options] - -O2 -fwrapv -fno-trapping-math (to enable saturating arithmetic and control trapping behavior); potentially -fsigned-zeros -fno-rounding-math (to enable COPYSIGN transformations); target architecture should support saturating and vector operations (e.g., -march=armv8-a+simd or -march=x86-64-v3).
[Basic Block 1] - Generate RTL for signed or unsigned saturating division where the divisor is the constant integer 1. This requires C/C++ code that uses saturating arithmetic intrinsics (e.g., __ssdiv, __usdiv for ARM) or compiler-builtin saturation operations, applied to a variable divided by 1. Example: `int x; int y = __ssdiv(x, 1);` The compiler must lower this to RTL with code SS_DIV or US_DIV and op1 being CONST1_RTX.
[Basic Block 2] - Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where both operands are identical RTX (same tree/value) and have no side effects. This requires an expression like `copysignf(x, x)` or `__builtin_copysign(x, x)`. The operands must be the same variable or constant.
[Basic Block 3] - Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where the second operand is a constant floating-point value (CONST_DOUBLE). This requires `copysignf(x, 2.0f)` or `copysignf(x, -3.0)`. The constant must be representable as a CONST_DOUBLE in the target mode.
[Basic Block 4] - Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where the first operand is a NEG or ABS unary operation. This requires `copysignf(-y, z)` or `copysignf(fabsf(y), z)`. The inner operation must be present in the RTL.
[Basic Block 5] - Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where the second operand is an ABS operation without side effects. This requires `copysignf(x, fabsf(y))`. The ABS must not have side effects (e.g., not volatile).
[Basic Block 6] - Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where the first operand is another COPYSIGN and its second operand has no side effects. This requires nested copysign like `copysignf(copysignf(a, b), c)` where `b` has no side effects.
[Basic Block 7] - Generate RTL for COPYSIGN where the second operand is another COPYSIGN and its first operand has no side effects. This requires `copysignf(a, copysignf(b, c))` where `b` has no side effects.
